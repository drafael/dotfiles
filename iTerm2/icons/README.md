1. Either download the zip file from the [releases page](https://github.com/jasonlong/iterm2-icons/releases) or clone this repository.

_Note that you'll need to repeat this process after updating to a new version of iTerm2._

### Figma source

If you'd like to make your own variation, you can take a look at the [Figma source file](https://www.figma.com/file/Ncz44QwwaKXTYejbBie8xe0B/iTerm2-icons?node-id=251%3A140). For creating the `.icns` files, I used [Icon Tool for Developers](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/icon-tool-for-developers/id554660130?mt=12).
