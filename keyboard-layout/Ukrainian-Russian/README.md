Tired of staring at a Russian flag while your country is being invaded by the Russian army, but still need to type with different keyboards including the Russian character set? Then just copy the `.keylayout` and `.icns` file into `/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/` on your Mac! You probably need to reboot and then you may choose the layout under System Preferences->Keyboard->Input Sources.

    git clone https://github.com/palmerc/Ukrainian-Russian.git
    cd Ukrainian-Russian/
    sudo cp Ukrainian\ \(Russian\).* /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/

### Modify the layout ###
